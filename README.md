The Secant Optimization Algorithm: A Novel Secant Method-Based Metaheuristic for Efficient Global Optimization
 
This paper introduces the Secant Optimization Algorithm (SOA), a novel mathematics-based metaheuristic optimization algorithm developed based on the principles of the Secant Method. The SOA enhances search efficiency by incrementally updating vector positions and leveraging local information and derivative approximations. The algorithm operates in two main stages: secant-based updates and stochastic exploration.  In the first stage, the algorithm uses secant-based updates to guide vector movements toward optimal positions. The second stage introduces a stochastic exploration strategy with an expansion factor, which promotes a broader search across the solution space and avoids stagnation in local optima. This expansion factor facilitates the identification of diverse and promising solutions, enabling a more effective global search. The performance of SOA was validated using a diverse set of benchmark functions, including 20-dimensional CEC2021 and 50- and 100-dimensional CEC2020 test problems, covering a range of low- to high-dimensional and nonlinear optimization challenges.
Additionally, SOA was applied to real-world engineering problems in power systems, specifically in parameter identification for photovoltaic (PV) systems. A comparative analysis was conducted against several state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, with SOA demonstrating competitive performance characterized by high convergence rates and improved solution accuracy. Furthermore, convergence curves and statistical analyses confirm SOAâ€™s ability to consistently achieve global optima, illustrating its versatility and potential as a valuable optimization tool across various complex engineering and computational applications.
